To Merge Separate Work to a Single Repo
1) Clone the repo from GitHub
$ git clone paste-copied-url-here
2) Create and check out a new branch (branch can be your name)
$ git checkout -b your_branch_name
3) Copy the files you want to upload into the relevant folders (README into the main folder, notebooks into code, images into images, etc)
4) Add the files to git. To be safe, add each individually instead of ‘add -a’ to ensure you are only adding the files you want to be included in the final check-in.
$ git add your_file_name
4) Commit the set of files to git
$ git commit
5) Push your branch to Github (push your branch name — NOT master)
$ git push -u origin your_branch_name
